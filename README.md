## About Me

I am a Data Science master’s student specializing in **Data Engineering and Machine Learning**, with a strong interest in building reliable data pipelines, transforming raw data into actionable insights, and deploying scalable analytics solutions.

Driven by problem-solving and technical challenges, I enjoy working across the full data lifecycle: data collection, processing, modeling, and deployment. My recent experiences has strengthened my skills in data processing, monitoring, automation, and dashboarding in real operational environments.

I am currently looking for a **6-month internship starting March 2026** as a **Data Engineer** or **Data Scientist**, where I can contribute to real-world data projects while deepening my expertise in modern data stacks.
